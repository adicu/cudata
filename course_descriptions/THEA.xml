<course_description>Admission information: Upon receipt of your online application, you will be asked to submit your resume or statement of your past theatrical and production experience to the workshop TA, so that we may assign working groups within the workshop that have a good balance of experience and interest. Join internationally renowned artists Richard Foreman and Sophie Haviland as The Bridge Project conducts a rare residency in the United States at the Columbia University School of the Arts. The Bridge Project is an international film and theatre initiative led by Richard Foreman and the principles he developed over 40 years of experimental art-making, and it is fueled by new art tools: digital technology and the internet. The core of the workshop is a 7-10 day film shoot in New York City to seed materialfilmed tableaux, monologues and other scenesto be used in the creation of new art works. Be among the 300 participating artists from 9 countries who have joined the international Bridge community since its inception five years ago, and plug into an elite and dynamic network of art organizations, institutions, professional artists and students committed to artistic exchange and collaboration. The Bridge Project follows an Open Source model, which means that all material created by the project can be used by any participating artist. The project encourages the sharing of creative and professional resources, especially across international borders, to create as many individual art works from Bridge material as possible, and to increase the potential for creative and cultural exchange among Bridge participants.</course_description>

<course_description>Come to Columbia University School of the Arts this summer and collaborate with artists from across disciplines &#38;ndash; theatre, film, performance and visual arts, writing, and music &#38;ndash; in a unique new laboratory environment: the Arts Collaboration Lab. The Arts Collaboration Lab is a pioneering, intensive summer workshop where artists and arts students from across disciplines work together to study collaborative techniques, to develop new projects, and to share ideas. Under the mentorship of internationally acclaimed professional artists and faculty members from Columbia University School of the Arts, the Collaboration Lab is a testing ground for artistic collaboration, where students expand and deepen their understanding of their own practice by working in partnership with artists from other genres and disciplines. Launching in July 2011, and run in conjunction with P.S.122 &#38;ndash; New York&#38;rsquo;s legendary downtown arts and performance center &#38;ndash; the three-week Collaboration Lab is an accredited course of Columbia University. In partnership with the Summer Residency Program, the Collaboration Lab will create a one-of-a-kind artistic community in the heart of New York City. Examples of collaborative student projects that might be developed at the Lab include: *A film director, a sculptor, and a choreographer collaborating on a site specific adaptation of Medea *A painter, a composer and a poet creating a virtual platform for illustrating e-literature *A playwright, a sound designer and a dramaturg exploring the frontiers of audio technology to create a personal, experiential walking tour of Upper Manhattan *A screenwriter, a musician and a videographer developing a blueprint for an online opera</course_description>

<course_description>This master class is designed for undergraduates and those new to Suzuki and Viewpoints training. The Suzuki Method is a rigorous physical and vocal discipline for actors, created by renowned theatre artist Tadashi Suzuki and his company. This method is designed to regain and refocus the perceptive abilities and powers of the human body and to restore the wholeness of the body as a tool of theatrical expression.Viewpoints is a technique of improvisation first articulated by choreographer Mary Overlie, who divided the two dominant issues performers deal with  time and space  into six categories. Her work represents a non-hierarchical, postmodern approach to theatre training, and it allows a group of actors to function together spontaneously and intuitively to generate bold, theatrical work.</course_description>
